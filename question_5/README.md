##Question 05 
In your view, what are the pros and cons of TDD (test driven development). When do you think TDD makes more/less sense (if ever)?

##Answer 
I believe that TDD -- when used in the right way and on the right projects -- can be an incredibly valuable development tool. While it does require more of an up-front time and and labor investment, and can make for a generally more time-consuming task, it ultimately focuses the project and helps identify issues before they can spiral out of control.

TDD is especially useful on large-scale projects that are working with a lot of user data. TDD allows the developers refine the design and narrow their focus on manageable pieces of a projects that could otherwise be overwhelming, given its large scope and dataset. It also helps mitigate bugs within the code, and helps identify and track any bugs that do appear before they impact large swaths of the project.

While it is a valuable tool, TDD does not make sense when working on a small-scale project, or are dealing with smaller amounts of user data. It may also not be the best approach when a project has to get off the ground quickly.
